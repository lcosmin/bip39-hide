# bip39-hide

DISCLAIMER: use at your own risk!

This tool attempts to make it harder for an attacker to identify your printed BIP39 passphrase by
placing the words inside a 16x16 matrix of other valid BIP39 words, making it more difficult for
an attacker to determine the correct ones without having the password.
